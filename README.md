Our study examined the question: Which passing strategy did teams employ under different game scenarios?

The two types of passing strategies we analyzed were north-south and east-west passing. North-South passing is when the possessing team passes the puck forwards or backwards, quickly moving the puck from one end to another and spreading the game out vertically. East-West passing is when the possessing team passes the puck side to side across the width of the ice, spreading out the game laterally. The majority of passes are a mixture of both, but the degrees at which the pass is made determines which type it is. 

The significance of NS/EW passing strategy analytics is often overlooked. While each hockey team has an overall style to their gameplay, the application of passing strategies plays to the strengths and weaknesses of the overall strategy. Which means, it affects the type of passing the other team will want to utilize.

We used rink plot visualizations and k-means clustering as our method. 

The are many things that this study provided for coaching insights, one being defensive strategy. This gives coaches the knowledge on the opposing teams strategies and how to counter them. It also allows coaches to see what type of passes and what location of passes are most successful/unsuccessful. Recognizing passing strategies and puck movement is a crucial element to creating both offensive and defensive in-game strategies, and this study provides that information for small and large samples of data.
