# It looks like the NA values occur on the x,y coordinates when a second player is not involved in the action

# The V1 column doesn't provide any additional information. How do we remove it?

# Are there any outliers or data entry errors in the dataset?

# What are the possible values for the fields: Event, Detail.1 - Detail.4, and how are they related?

# The game_date is currently a chr value. Should this be a date-time object? How would we convert it?

# The clock is currently a chr value. Should this be a date-time object?
